Browsers Limit to 6 Simultaneous Connections per Hostname

Also, 
    - no data fee for data coming into AWS
    - no data fee for data from S3 -> EC2 (assuming also applies to S3 => Lambda within Region)
    
NodeJS Limit Simultaneous Requests?

Solution Could be AJAX request => Serverless function => Parallel S3 requests collating data.
Data reduced in cloud and sent to Application.



 - Load example Data into S3
    Format: dataset/sequence_type/sequence_num/geoid
    

- Server(less) function handles logic of which attribute to get.

To Build

BASH - with AWS CLI Load one sample sequence file into S3

HTML - Simple Sample AJAX POST request, 
{ ids: 1000 Tract GEOIDs, attr: attribute formula (simple value or attribute/total) }

Serverless function:
    Makes a Call for Each GEOID.
    Extract data for each GEOID and find needed attribute based on supplied formula.
    send JSON [{geoid, value}] (later send GL Map Style Only?)
